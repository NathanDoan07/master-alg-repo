## Description
- This repo contains links to all other algorithms that were created. 
- If unable to access the links, please email for a request. 
- All algorithms have been written in Python.
- For ease of use/proof, all algorithms have been given datasets to test and do not take user input. 
- If the user wishes to test on different values, an IDE will be required to directly edit the file.
