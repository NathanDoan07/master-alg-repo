## Description
- This repo contains links to all other algorithms that were created. 
- If unable to access the links, please email for a request. 
- All algorithms have been written in Python.
- For ease of use/proof, all algorithms have been given datasets to test and do not take user input. 
- If the user wishes to test on different values, an IDE will be required to directly edit the file.

## Datasets and Algorithms:
- All algorithms have an image attached with the psuedocode of the algorithm along with an image (if applicable) from the slides to test against as datasets. The exception is Dijkstra and Merge Sort, which instead I used an online website along with supplements from the slides (Source on repo).

- Knapsack only has an image with the psuedocode, the dataset used was obtained from a website (Source on repo).
